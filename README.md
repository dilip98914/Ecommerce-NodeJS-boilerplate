### Ecommerce NodeJS boilerplate

This repo is built to headstart any web app. You can use this app as boilerplate to quickly build large scale app.
It was written to test my rapid prototyping skills, though I was slow and took very large breaks but still done this in 1-2 days(between). 

# Technologies used
NodeJS,express
mongoDB,mongoose,
react,contextAPI
razorpay

# features
1.login,signup,(jwt based authentication)
2.shop to buy products
3.cart where added products go and final price is calculated
4.finally payment gateway to purchase that item
Note:used context API for state management with functional components
code is badly written, but it was fun!
